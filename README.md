# Perceptron-and-MLP

**Reading**

1) XOR Problem: http://www.deeplearningbook.org/contents/mlp.html. Read until Gradient Based Learning (pg.172)

2) GPU's and deep learning: https://www.google.co.in/search?q=gpus+and+deep+learning&oq=gpu%27s+and+dee&aqs=chrome.1.69i57j0l5.4335j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8


**Exercise**

- Try the Pecptron and MLPClassifier on the XOR dataset (Its just five rows of data, can be found in the MLP chapter of deeplearning book I have linked above. 

- Also try the MLPClassifer on the Telecom Dataset for handson practice for parameter turning. Remember: You must scale the X_Test AND X_Train data before fitting.)
